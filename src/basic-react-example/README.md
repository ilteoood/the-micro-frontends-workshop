# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `app1` is the host application.
- `app2` standalone application which exposes `Button` component.

# Running Demo

Run `npm start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.
